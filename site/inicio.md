My name is José Figueroa Martínez. I work as Software Developer in [Nedat](www.nedap.com) since 10/2018.

I have a PhD and Master grade in Software Development by the [Universidad de Granada](http://www.ugr.es) (UTM), Spain, and a Bachelor in Computer Science by the [Universidad de Sonora](http://www.uson.mx)

My current interests are functional programming, web development, microservices and cool software architectures. I am fan of [Clojure](http://www.clojure.org) and [Clojurescript](http://www.clojurescript.org) but I usually keep an eye on any interesting technology around.

Thanks for your visit :-)
