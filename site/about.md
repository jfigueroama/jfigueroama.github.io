I am a Computer Scientist passionated about functional programming, web development and the correct use of technology. My favorite programming language is Clojure, but I am always exploring new and old languages.

I have liked martial arts since childhood. I really like Aikido because of its philosophy and the kind of movements it use. It is like dancing with a clear and fearless mind.

I was born in the 80's and I enjoy all kind of music, from Sweelinck, Bach, Mozart to Heroes del Silencio, Rammstein and Postmodern Jukebox.

Before having children my days were full of little activities and hobbies. Right now the most difficult task in my life is paternity and been a good husband. It is the hardest thing I have ever done, but it worth it and is giving me lot of joyness and purpose.
